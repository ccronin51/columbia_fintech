## Business Activities

Wise's compeitive advantage is it low exchange rates and tech infastructure.

Unlike its competitors, which include traditional banks and payment companies, Wise doesn't mark up its exchange rates or add in any hidden fees. It uses the real exchange rate, which is the middle rate of buying and selling currencies. 

Wise has built a robust technical infastructure that allows it to build high-value features quickly and enable banking partners to easily plug-in and offer their solution.


* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like StackShare to find this information.)

Wise uses various technologies to power their backend, front-end, and android & iOS mobile apps. The company's tech stack incorporates standard and cutting edge technology that enables developers to push features at high velocity while incorporating standardization for scale and automated tests for quality and audits. 

600 backend services run on JVM, using Spring Boot and are written in Java. The front-end stack is built on Next.js using TypeScript. iOS is written in Swift while Android is written in Kotlin; both apps are modularised. Backend has approximately 700 releases a week while mobile has 1 release a week. 

Wise build their own framework called Dynamic Forms for mobile apps to push native changes more easily without the headache of needing mobile app updates. 

Wise uses Maria DB, Postgres, and Mongo for data processing and Snowflake as their data warehouse. The company uses Looker for data visualization and machine learning is done using AWS SageMaker.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

In 2023, WISE facilitated international transfers for 9.5M people and 0.5M businesses. 

WISE's business impact can be measured in £ saved for their customers by not going with tradtional banks, which reached £1.5B saved in 2023.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

Core metrics include those that cover reach, depth, efficiency, and financial returns of Wise's product offerings:

2023 Metrics:
 - Currencies 40+ 
 - Countries: 170+ 
 - Active Users: 10M
 - Total Volume: £105B
 - Revenue: 846M
 - EPS: 11.54
 - £ Saved: 1.5B
 - Transactions completed instantly: 55% (less than 20 seconds)

WISE is performing quite well with  Active Customers up 34% Y/Y,Total Volume up 37% Y/Y, Revenue up 51% Y/Y, and EPS up 239% Y/Y.
 
WISE still has the opportunity to expand the number of currencies offered, to compete with a number of competitors who offer more.

For Active Users, 10M is 3x than 2020 Active Users but a tiny fraction of the overall market potential; 10M equates to only .5% of people and less than 1% of businesses. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

Compared to traditional banks, WISE is peforming quite well with £1.5B saved for customers in 2023.

Compared to other FinTech payment companies (e.g. Revolut), WISE offers the best value for exchange rate markups but isn't the cheapest when it comes to the transfer fees it charges, which is a percentage of each transaction. Their platform is easy to use and fast but customer support is limited and doesn't offer cash home delivery. Although WISE offers a debit card, it lacks a lot of the perks that other payment companies offer. In summary, WISE is the go-to payment for fast, secure transfers with the least amount of markups on exchange rates. They can improve their product offerings with lower fees and more coverage and perks.


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

Wise has three main products: 

Wise Accounts is their flagship product for general public where people can make money transfers store money in an account that can earn interest. 

Wise Business is for SME's to manage international payments for their employers and suppliers.

Wise Platform is for larger financial institutions that allows these partners to plug-in to WISE's tech infrastructure so that they can offer their customers competitive international money transfers

I suggest that WISE offer a fourth product: Wise Rewards

Wise Rewards would enable customers to earn points on their international transactions that they could then apply to reward benefits, which would keep customers satisfied while also growing new partnerships where these benefits would come from. 

For example, a customer could earn points for each dollar transferred and use these points as cash back in their account or apply the points to receiving perks and benefits. These benefits could include international travel bookings or even the opportunity to invest in select funds. For the Wise customer, this is a benefit at no cost -- they just need to use the product. It creates more engagment and loyalty as they get additional satisfaction of using Wise. 

For Wise, a rewards systems will help retain customers while also partnering with different channels where customers can transfer money. Loyalty programs have seen tremendous success and are widely used by companies to retain customers. Studies have shown that more than 75% of consumers are likely to stay with a brand that offers a loyalty program. 


* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

After setting loyalty program goals, rules, and redemption options, Wise could use blockchain technology for its loyalty program that would be custom built as part of its backend infrastructure. According to Deloitte, “Blockchain is an ideal remedy for what ails loyalty reward programs” for numerous reasons. It offers security, speed, and scalability while also acting as a single layer of truth. Additionally, it can lead to cost savings and integrate more smoothly with program partner APIs.
