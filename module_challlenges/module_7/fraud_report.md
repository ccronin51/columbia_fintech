## Fraud Report

* Based on counting the amount of small transactions less than 2 dollars, there is no clear evidence of a credit card being hacked but it could be worthwile to investigate names that have count of 10 or more small transcations, especially Megan Price at 16 small transactions in 2018

* Analysis of transaction amounts between 7 and 9 am provides no clear evidence of anomalous activity but there is a significant increase in the amount of top 7 transactions (>700) versus all the other transaction amounts (<25). It would be worthwile to investigate the top 7 transactions to see if there's fraud

* The average amount of transactions during the rest of the day (not between 7 and 9 am) is much higher than between 7 and 9 am. The top transaction amounts between 7 and 9 am would be normal transaction amounts during the rest of the day. There could be a lot of fraudulent transactions from 7 to 9 am based on the theory that small transaction amounts tend to be fraudulent because they can go unnoticed. However, it may just be that in the morning people don't spend that much and only spend on small items.

* Looking at the top two most important customers, cardholder 2 has a steady amount of small transactions less than 20 dollars with a number of transactions at only $ dollar. Cardholder 18 has a number of small transactions too but with several high transaction amounts above 1K. The difference doesn't necessarily suggest a fraudulent transaction. Cardholder 18 could be an important customer in terms of spending amount while Cardholder 2 could be an important customer for another reason. 

* The CEO is right to be suspicious of fraudulent activity on her card during the first quarter of 2019. There are a number outliers represented by the dots in the boxplot for first quareter 2018. Some months have no outliers while other months can have up to three outliers. It is worth investigatint these high transactions for possible fraud concerning lavish dinner expenses
